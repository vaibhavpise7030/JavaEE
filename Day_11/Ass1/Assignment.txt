1) create an entity "Product" with
	int pid  [id]
	String pname
	int qty
	int price

Home.jsp  (should be the welcome page)
inside "Home.jsp",

two links

	add product
	view product

when user clicks on "add product", control goes to "Add.jsp" which will accept 
	product name , price and quantity
on click of "submit" , control goes to 	"AddServlet" which will use hibernate to persist the "Product" class instance inside database.
Now servlet will forward the request to "Home.jsp"

when user clicks on "view product", control goes to "ViewServlet" which will use hibernate to retrieve all the records from Product table.
servlet will get List which contains all the objects ( HQL )
store it inside request attribute and then forward request to "View.jsp".
View.jsp will display all the objects using jstl and el.
also in "View.jsp", there should be a link "go home" on click of which control should go back to "Home.jsp"
